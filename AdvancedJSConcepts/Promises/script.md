# PROMISES

## Handle Asynchronous Operations with Promises
## Resolve/Reject : Handle Success/Failure
## Then/Catch : Handle Success/Failure(errors)
## Can be changed
## make async code more manageable
## use async/await syntax to make it look like synchronous code
## handle potential errors with .catch()
## execute immediately
## Promise chains are microtasks in event loop
## uncaught rejections trigger global event
## use .finally() to handle cleanup code
## use .all() to handle multiple promises
## use .race() to handle first promise to resolve
## use .any() to handle first promise to resolve
## use .allSettled() to handle all promises to settle


# STATES:
